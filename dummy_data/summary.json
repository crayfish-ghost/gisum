  "body": "Is it possible to make ChatGPTFree adhere more strictly to the user-defined system role? Currently, ChatGPTFree seems to deviate from the assigned system role too easily, unlike other OpenAI's models. This appears to be a limitation of the API. OpenAI's documentation states the Gpt-3.5-turbo model does not always pay attention to system messages and advises placing important instructions in the user message instead (https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/How_to_format_inputs_to_ChatGPT_models.ipynb).\r\n\r\nThere were a couple of suggestions in this thread (https://community.openai.com/t/system-message-how-to-force-chatgpt-api-to-follow-it/82775/11) to improve adherence to the system role:\r\n\r\n1) set the temperature to a lower value (such as 0.1), which ChatGPTFree users can do through the interface. \r\n2) place the \"system\" as the last object in the messages array, even after the last user prompt (see the bottom message of the thread). This on the other hand would require changes to the code, which I would think would be minor.\r\n\r\nCurrently, does ChatGPTfree state the last user-defined system role in every API request?",
